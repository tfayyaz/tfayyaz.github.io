# Test

The Apache Airflow Metadata databse contains a lot of useful information about DAGs and to get a better understanding of what can be done with access the metadata I carried out some exploratory data analysis after enabling all the example DAGs inclduing in a local install of Airlow.

## Set-up Airflow locally

## Access the SQLlite Metadata database
